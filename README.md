TASK 1 - TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION


Problem Statement:

The project utilizes the Titanic dataset, which contains information about individual passengers such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived. 
The primary objective is to build a predictive model that accurately classifies passengers into survived or not survived categories based on the available features.

Project Explaination:
The Titanic Survival Prediction project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to solve a classic classification problem. By leveraging the available dataset and following a systematic approach, a predictive model is developed to classify passengers into survived or not survived categories with high accuracy,
thereby contributing to the understanding of the factors influencing survival on the Titanic.

TASK 2 - MOVIE RATING PREDICTION WITH PYTHON

Problem Statement:

The problem at hand is to develop a model that can predict the rating of a movie accurately based on various features such as genre, director, and actors. This involves leveraging machine learning regression techniques to analyze historical movie data and uncover the relationships between these features and the resulting ratings. By doing so, we aim to address the challenge of accurately estimating the perceived quality of a movie, which is valuable for both users and critics in making informed decisions about which movies to watch or review.

Project Explanation:

The Movie Rating Prediction project presents an opportunity to delve into the intricacies of data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques. It begins with the collection and exploration of historical movie data, where various attributes including genre, director, and actors are examined. Through thorough analysis and visualization, insights into the relationships between these features and movie ratings are uncovered. Following this, preprocessing steps such as handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features are performed to prepare the data for modeling. Subsequently, a regression model is trained on the preprocessed data to predict movie ratings. The model is then evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess its performance and fine-tuned as necessary to improve its accuracy. Overall, this project offers a comprehensive learning experience in building predictive models for real-world applications and provides valuable insights into the factors influencing movie ratings.
