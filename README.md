TASK 1 - TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTION


Problem Statement:

The project utilizes the Titanic dataset, which contains information about individual passengers such as their age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, and whether or not they survived. 
The primary objective is to build a predictive model that accurately classifies passengers into survived or not survived categories based on the available features.

Project Explaination:
The Titanic Survival Prediction project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to solve a classic classification problem. By leveraging the available dataset and following a systematic approach, a predictive model is developed to classify passengers into survived or not survived categories with high accuracy,
thereby contributing to the understanding of the factors influencing survival on the Titanic.
